            Our goal is to help more people from more backgrounds experience the
            joy of <br /> exploration. Because we believe this builds a kinder,

            Like you, travel is in our DNA. At Lonely Planet, we believe travel
            opens the door to <br /> the greatest, most unforgettable
            experiences life can offer. And we have learned <br /> that the best
            travel is about putting yourself out there, about leaving behind the{" "}
            <br /> everyday, about immersing yourself, rather than just seeing
            the sights.

            As travelers, you&apos;re on a journey, and at Lonely Planet,
            we&apos;re on one, too. Over the <br /> last two years, travel has
            transformed. We&apos;re thinking deeply not just about how <br /> we travel
            but why we travel and how to <br /> best serve travelers on their journey â€“
            and we approach our 50th year with a passion and commitment to
            helping others do <br /> it, too.
